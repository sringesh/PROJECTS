# Smart Water Monitoring & Control System 💧🌍

Water is used everywhere — but it’s rarely understood, controlled, or optimized.  
This project was built to change that.

**Smart Water Monitoring & Control System** is a full-stack IoT solution that tracks real-time water usage, gives users control over water flow, and actively encourages smarter consumption through insights, gamification, and automation.

It doesn’t just show data — it helps people **use less water, consciously**.

## 🚀 What It Does

- 💧 **Real-Time Water Usage Tracking**  
  Measures the exact amount of water used using a flow sensor connected to an ESP32.

- 🌐 **Cloud-Connected Web Dashboard**  
  Water usage data is securely stored in Firebase and visualized through a web app, with daily and monthly breakdowns accessible from anywhere.

- 🎛️ **Remote Water Flow Control**  
  A servo-controlled valve allows users to remotely reduce or regulate water flow directly from the web application.

- 🤖 **AI-Based Personalized Insights**  
  Analyzes consumption patterns and provides intelligent, personalized suggestions to help users reduce water waste.

- 🔥 **Gamification & Streak System**  
  Snapchat-style streaks and competitive elements motivate users to build consistent water-saving habits.

- 🔊 **Voice-Based Monthly Billing**  
  Monthly water usage and billing details are delivered in voice format for better accessibility and user engagement.

- 📊 **Historical Data & Analytics**  
  All usage data is saved and analyzed to help users understand long-term trends and improve consumption behavior.
